ANU Honours Thesis by Christopher Williams

Here you will find python notebooks that are intended to be read interactively within the chapters of my thesis. 

The thesis itself is self-contained, but should a reader desire to perform any of the computations the code is made available.

To run this, simply download (or clone) the repository and run the notebooks labelled `Chapter_*'. 
A Jupyter environment is needed with Python 3 (Python 2 to run the deterministic algorithm with picture manipulation). 
This can be done through Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ .

Thanks and enjoy!
