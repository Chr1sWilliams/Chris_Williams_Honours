ANU Honours Thesis by Christopher Williams

Here you will find python notebooks that are intended to be read interactively within the chapters of my thesis. 

The thesis itself is self-contained, but should a reader desire to perform any of the computations, the computational experiments are made available.

To run this, simply download (or clone) the repository and run the notebooks labelled `Chapter_*'. 
The notebooks have also been printed to pdf and can be read within the web-browser with no additional software required.
Additionally, GitHub supports viewing the notebooks within the browser with no need to install anyting.
The Python files only include functions made to be called upon in the notebooks and hidden away in these files for readability.
A Jupyter environment is needed with Python 3 if computations want to be run. 
This can be done through Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ .

Thanks and (hopefully) enjoy!
