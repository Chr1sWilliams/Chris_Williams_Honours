Honours Thesis by Christopher Williams

Here you will find python notebooks that are intended to be read interactively within the chapters of my thesis. The thesis itself is self-contained, but should a reader desire to perform any of the computations themselves, the code is here.
To run this, you need to have a Jupyter environment installed. This can be done through Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ .

Enjoy!
